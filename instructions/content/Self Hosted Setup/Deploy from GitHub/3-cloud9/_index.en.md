After completed either of 2 previous sections ([AWS hosted](/0-setup/1-aws-hosted.html) or [self hosted](/0-setup/1-awselfs-hosted.html)) an [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) instance is been created for you.
 {{% /notice %}}

Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.

Your Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS Management Console. We strongly recommend using Cloud9 to complete this workshop.

## Starting AWS Cloud9 ##


1. Go to the AWS Management Console, Select **Services** then select [**Cloud9**](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) under Developer Tools. From the top-right of the Console, select the  region for this workshop.  Use the same region for the entirety of this workshop.

7. From the Cloud9 Navigtion, select *Your environments*, then choose *Open IDE* from the newly created Cloud9 instace named *Serverlesspresso-development*.

7. This opens up at the Cloud9 IDE welcome screen. Below that, you should see a terminal prompt. Close the *Welcome* tab and drag up the terminal window to give yourself more space to work in.

You can run AWS CLI commands here just like you would on your local computer. Remember for this workshop to run all commands within the Cloud9 terminal window instead of your local computer.

Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a browser tab throughout this workshop.


{{% notice tip %}}

Keep an open scratch pad in Cloud9 or a text editor on your local computer for notes. When the step-by-step directions tell you to note something such as
an ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN), copy and paste that into your scratch pad.
